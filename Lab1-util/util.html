<h1>Lab: Xv6 and Unix utilities</h1>

This lab makes you familiar with xv6 and its system calls.

<h2>Boot xv6</h2>

<p>You must use an x86 Athena machine; that is, <tt>uname -a</tt>
should mention <tt>i386 GNU/Linux</tt> or <tt>i686 GNU/Linux</tt> or
<tt>x86_64 GNU/Linux</tt>.
You can log into a public Athena host with <tt>ssh -X athena.dialup.mit.edu</tt>.
</p>

<p>We have set up the appropriate compilers and simulators for you on
Athena.  To use them, run <kbd>add -f 6.828</kbd>.  You must run this
command every time you log in (or add it to your
<tt>~/.environment</tt> file).  If you get obscure errors while
compiling or running <tt>qemu</tt>, double check that you added the
course locker.</p>

<p>Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the <tt>util</tt> branch:

<pre>
$ <kbd>git clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv-fall19.git</kbd>
Cloning into 'xv6-riscv'...
...
$ <kbd>cd xv6-riscv-fall19</kbd>
$ <kbd>git checkout util</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The xv6-riscv-fall19 repository differs slightly from the book's xv6-riscv 
  in order to make the labs easier.

<p>The files you will need for this and subsequent lab assignments in
this course are distributed using
the <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control system.
Above you created a new branch (<kbd>git branch util</kbd>) for your
solutions for the utilities lab.  To learn more about Git, take a look at the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">Git
user's manual</a>, or, you may find this
<a href="http://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/">CS-oriented
overview of Git</a> useful.
Git allows you to keep track of the changes you make to the code.
For example, if you are finished with one of the exercises, and want
to checkpoint your progress, you can <i>commit</i> your changes
by running:
</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -am 'my solution for util lab exercise 1'</kbd>
Created commit 60d2135: my solution for util lab exercise 1
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
$
</pre>

<p>
You can keep track of your changes by using the <kbd>git diff</kbd>
command.  Running <kbd>git diff</kbd> will display the changes to your
code since your last commit, and <kbd>git diff
origin/xv6-riscv-fall19</kbd> will display the changes relative to the
initial xv6-riscv-fall19 code.  Here, <tt>origin/xv6-riscv-fall19</tt> is the
name of the git branch with the initial code you downloaded for the
class.
</p>

<p>Build xv6 on Athena:
<pre>
$ <kbd>make</kbd>
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc    -c -o kernel/entry.o kernel/entry.S
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -Wall -Werror -O -fno-omit-frame-pointer -ggdb -MD -mcmodel=medany -ffreestanding -fno-common -nostdlib -mno-relax -I. -fno-stack-protector -fno-pie -no-pie   -c -o kernel/start.o kernel/start.c
...
$ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>

</pre>

<p>
If you type <tt>ls</tt> at the prompt, you should see output similar to the following:
<pre>
$ <kbd>ls</kbd>
.              1 1 1024
..             1 1 1024

cow            2 18 27152
console        3 19 0
</pre>
These are the programs/files that <tt>mkfs</tt> includes in the
initial file system.  You just ran one of them: <tt>ls</tt>.

<p>If you are working on a non-Athena machine, you'll need to install
<tt>qemu</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> for RISC-V following the directions on
the <a href="../tools.html">tools page</a>.
</p>

<h2>Hand-in procedure</h2>

<p>
You will turn in your assignments using the <a
href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2019/handin.py/">submission website</a>.
You need to request an API key from the submission website before you can turn
in any assignments or labs.
</p>

<p>
The lab code comes with GNU Make rules to make submission easier. After
committing your final changes to the lab, type <kbd>make handin</kbd> to submit
your lab.
<pre>
$ <kbd>git commit -am "ready to submit my lab"</kbd>
[util c2e3c8b] ready to submit my lab
 2 files changed, 18 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)

$ <kbd>make handin</kbd>
git archive --prefix=util/ --format=tar HEAD | gzip &gt; util-handin.tar.gz
Get an API key for yourself by visiting https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2018/handin.py/
Please enter your API key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

$
</pre>
<kbd>make handin</kbd> will store your API key in <i>myapi.key</i>. If you need
to change your API key, just remove this file and let <kbd>make handin</kbd>
generate it again (<i>myapi.key</i> must not include newline characters).
</p>

<p>
If use <kbd>make handin</kbd> and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
<pre>
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
</pre>
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked i.e. not listed in a line that begins with <kbd>??</kbd>.
You can cause <tt>git</tt> to track a new file that you create using
<tt>git add filename</tt>.
</p>

<p>
In the case that <kbd>make handin</kbd> does not work properly, 
try fixing the problem with the curl or Git commands.
Or you can run <kbd>make tarball</kbd>.
This will make a tar file for you, which you can
then upload via our 
<a href="https://6828.scripts.mit.edu/2019/handin.py/">web interface</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can run <kbd>make grade</kbd>
to test your solutions with the grading program. The TAs will use the same
grading program to assign your lab submission a grade.
</p>

<h2>sleep</h2>



<div class="required">
<p>Implement the UNIX program sleep for xv6; your sleep should pause
  for a user-specified number of ticks.  (A tick is a notion of time
  defined by the xv6 kernel, namely the time between two interrupts
  from the timer chip.)  Your solution should be in the file
  <tt>user/sleep.c</tt>.
</div>

<p>

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Look at some of the other programs in <tt>user/</tt> to see
    how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.  If the user
    forgets to pass an argument, sleep should print an error message.

    <li>The command-line argument is passed as a string; you can convert it to an
      integer using <tt>atoi</tt> (see user/ulib.c).

    <li>Use the system call <tt>sleep</tt> (see user/usys.S and kernel/sysproc.c).

    <li>Make sure <tt>main</tt> calls <tt>exit()</tt> in order to exit
    your program.

    <li>Add the program to <tt>UPROGS</tt> in Makefile and compile
      user programs by typing <tt>make fs.img</tt>.

    <li>Look at Kernighan and Ritchie's book <i>The C programming language
        (second edition)</i> (K&R) to learn about C.

  </ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell:
    <pre>
      $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
      ...
      init: starting sh
      $ <kbd>sleep 10</kbd>
      (nothing happens for a little while)
      $
    </pre>
  <p>Your solution is correct, if your program behaves as shown above.

  <p>Optional: write an uptime program that prints the uptime in terms
    of ticks using the <tt>uptime</tt> system call.

<h2>pingpong</h2>

<div class="required">
<p> Write a program that uses UNIX system calls to ``ping-pong'' a
  byte between two processes over a pair of pipes, one for each
  direction. The parent sends by writing a byte to <tt>parent_fd[1]</tt> and
  the child receives it by reading from <tt>parent_fd[0]</tt>. After
  receiving a byte from parent, the child responds with its own byte
  by writing to <tt>child_fd[1]</tt>, which the parent then reads.  Your
  solution should be in the file <tt>user/pingpong.c</tt>.
</div>

<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Use <tt>pipe</tt> to create a pipe.
    <li>Use <tt>fork</tt> to create a child.
    <li>Use <tt>read</tt> to read from the pipe, and <tt>write</tt> to write to the pipe.
  </ul>

  <p>Run the program from the xv6 shell and it should produce the
  following output:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>pingpong</kbd>
    4: received ping
    3: received pong
    $
  </pre>
    <p>Your solution is correct, if your program behaves as shown above.
  The number before ":" is the process id of the process printing the
  output.  You can get the process id by calling the system call <tt>getpid</tt>.

  
<h2>primes</h2>

<div class="required">
  <p>Write a concurrent version of prime sieve using pipes.  This idea
    is due to Doug McIlroy, inventor of Unix pipes.  The picture
    halfway down <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/">this page</a>
    and the surrounding text explain how to do it.  Your
    solution should be in the file <tt>user/primes.c</tt>.
</div>

    <p>Your goal is to use <tt>pipe</tt> and <tt>fork</tt> to set up
    the pipeline. The first process feeds the numbers 2 through 35
    into the pipeline.  For each prime number, you will arrange to
    create one process that reads from its left neighbor over a pipe
    and writes to its right neighbor over another pipe. Since xv6 has
    limited number of file descriptors and processes, the first
    process can stop at 35.
    
<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Be careful to close file descriptors that a process doesn't
    need, because otherwise your program will run xv6 out of resources
    before the first process reaches 35.
      
    <li>Once the first process reaches 35, you should arrange that the
    pipeline terminates cleanly, including all children (Hint: read will return an end-of-file
      when the write-side of the pipe is closed).

    <li>It's simplest to directly write 32-bit <tt>int</tt>s to the
        pipes, rather than using formatted ASCII I/O.

    <li>You should create the processes in the pipeline as they are needed.

  </ul>

<p>Your solution is correct if it produces the following output:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>primes</kbd>
    prime 2
    prime 3
    prime 5
    prime 7
    prime 11
    prime 13
    prime 17
    prime 19
    prime 23
    prime 29
    prime 31
    $
  </pre>
  
<h2>find</h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Write a simple version of the UNIX find program: find all the files
  in a directory tree whose name matches a string.  Your solution
  should be in the file <tt>user/find.c</tt>.
  
</div>
  
<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Look at user/ls.c to see how to read directories.
    <li>Use recursion to allow find to descend into sub-directories.
    <li>Don't recurse into "." and "..".
    <li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kbd>make clean</kbd> and then <kbd>make qemu</kbd>.
    <li>You'll need to use C strings. Have a look at K&R (the C book),
        for example Section 5.5.
  </ul>

<p>Optional: support regular expressions in name
  matching.  <tt>grep.c</tt> has some primitive support for regular
  expressions.

<p>Your solution is correct if produces the following output (when the
  file system contains a file <tt>a/b</tt>):
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
    ...
    init: starting sh
    $ <kbd>mkdir a</kbd>
    $ <kbd>echo > a/b</kbd>
    $ <kbd>find . b</kbd>
    ./a/b
    $ 
  </pre>

<h2>xargs</h2>

<div class="required">
<p>Write a simple version of the UNIX xargs program: read lines from
  standard input and run a command for each line, supplying the line as
  arguments to the command.   Your solution
  should be in the file <tt>user/xargs.c</tt>.
</div>

  The following example illustrates xarg's
  behavior:
  <pre>
    $ <kbd>xargs echo bye</kbd>
    hello too
    bye hello too
    <kbd>ctrl-d</kbd>
    $
  </pre>
  Note that the command here is "echo bye" and the additional
  arguments are "hello too", making the command "echo bye hello too",
  which outputs "bye hello too".
  
<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Use <tt>fork</tt> and <tt>exec</tt> system call to invoke the
      command on each line of input.  Use <tt>wait</tt> in the parent
      to wait for the child to complete running the command.
    <li>Read from stdin a character at the time until the newline
      character ('\n').
    <li>kernel/param.h declares MAXARG, which may be useful if you need
      to declare an argv.
    <li>Changes to the file system persist across runs of qemu; to get
    a clean file system run <kdb>make clean</kdb> and then <kdb>make qemu</kdb>.
  </ul>

<p>xargs, find, and grep combine well:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>find . b | xargs grep hello</kbd>
  </pre>
  will run "grep hello" on each file named b in the directories below
  ".".

<p>To test your solution for xargs, run the shell script xargstest.sh.
Your solution is correct if it produces the following output:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>make qemu</kbd>
  ...
  init: starting sh
  $ <kbd>sh < xargstest.sh</kbd>
  $ $ $ $ $ $ hello
  hello
  hello
  $ $   
  </pre>
You may have to fix bugs in your find program.  The output has
many <tt>$</tt> because the xv6 shell is primitive and doesn't realize
it is processing commands from a file instead of from the console, and
prints a <tt>$</tt> for each command in the file.

<p>
<b>This completes the lab.</b>
In the <tt>lab</tt> directory, commit your changes with 
<kbd>git commit</kbd> and
type <kbd>make handin</kbd> to submit your code.
