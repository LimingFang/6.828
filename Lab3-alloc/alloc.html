<h1>Lab: Allocator for xv6</h2>

<p>
<div class="required">
  For this lab we have replaced the page allocator in the xv6 kernel with a buddy
  allocator.  You will modify xv6 to use this allocator to allocate and free file
  structs so that xv6 can have more open file descriptors than the
  existing system-wide limit <tt>NFILE</tt>.  Furthermore, you will
  implement an optimization that reduces the buddy's use of memory.
  You are done if your modified kernel passes both alloctest and
  usertests.
</div>
 
<p>To start the lab, switch to the alloc branch:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout alloc</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The only files you should change in this lab are kernel/buddy.c and
kernel/file.c.

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>xv6 has only a page allocator and cannot dynamically allocate
objects smaller than a page.  To work around this limitation, xv6
declares objects smaller than a page statically.  For example, xv6
declares an array of file structs, an array of proc structures, and so
on.  As a result, the number of files the system can have open is
limited by the size of the statically declared file array, which
has <tt>NFILE</tt> entries (see kernel/file.c and kernel/param.h).

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>The solution is to adopt the buddy allocator
  from <a href="../lec/malloc.c">the allocator lecture</a>, which we have
  added to xv6 in kernel/buddy.c and kernel/list.c.

<h2>Your job</h2>

<p>
Your job is to further improve xv6's memory allocation in two ways:


  <ul>
    
  <li>Modify <tt>kernel/file.c</tt> to use the
  buddy allocator so that the number of file structures is limited by
  memory rather than <tt>NFILE</tt>.

    <li>The buddy allocator is space inefficient.  The <tt>alloc</tt>
    array has a bit for each block for each size. There is a clever
    optimization that reduces the cost to only one bit for each pair of
    blocks. This single bit is B1_is_free XOR B2_is_free, for a buddy
    pair of blocks B1 and B2.  Each time a block is allocated or
    freed, you flip the bit to reflect the change.  For example, if B1
    and B2 are allocated, the bit will be zero and if B1 is freed the
    bit changes to 1.  If the bit is 1 and B2 is freed, then we know
    that B1 and B2 should be merged. Saving 1/2 bit per block matters
    when xv6 uses the buddy allocator for the roughly 128 Mbyte of
    free memory that xv6 must manage: this optimization saves about 1
    MByte of memory.
      
  </ul>


<h2>The alloctest program</h2>

<p>To help you test your implementation, we've provided an xv6 program
called alloctest (source in user/alloctest.c). It has two
tests.

<p>
The first test allocates more than <tt>NFILE</tt>
file structures by creating many processes, each opening many file
descriptors. The first test will fail on unmodified xv6.

<p>
The second test creates a
process that allocates as much memory as possible, and fails
if less than a certain amount is available.
It's effectively a test to see how much memory the kernel is using.
The test will fail with the unoptimized buddy
allocator that we have given you.

<p>When you are done, your kernel should be able to run both alloctest
and usertests. That is:

<pre>
$ <kbd>alloctest</kbd>
filetest: start
filetest: OK
memtest: start
memtest: OK
$ <kbd>usertests</kbd>
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$
</pre>

<h2>Hints</h2>

  <li> You'll want to remove line 19 in kernel/file.c, which
  declares <tt>file[NFILE]</tt>. Instead, allocate <tt>struct
  file</tt> in <tt>filealloc</tt> using <tt>bd_malloc</tt>.
  In <tt>fileclose</tt> you will free the allocated memory. Note that
  you can simplify <tt>fileclose</tt>, because <tt>ff</tt> isn't
  needed.

  <li> <tt>fileclose</tt> still needs to acquire <tt>ftable.lock</tt>
  because the lock protects <tt>f->ref</tt>.
  

  <li><tt>bd_malloc</tt> doesn't clear the memory it returns;
  instead, allocated memory starts out with whatever content
  it had from its last use.
  Callers should not assume that it starts out containing zeroes.

  <li>You can use <tt>bd_print</tt> to print the state of the
    allocator.

  <li>Compared to the lecture notes, we have
    modified <tt>bd_init</tt> so that it is
    called with the range of physical memory
    available for allocation.
    <tt>bd_init</tt> allocates
    memory for the buddy data structures from that memory.
    It initializes its data structures
    accordingly: <tt>bd_init</tt> marks memory that is used for buddy
    data structures as allocated so that it won't be
    re-allocated. Furthermore, we have modified <tt>bd_init</tt> to handle
    an amount of memory that isn't a power of 2 by marking unavailable memory as
    allocated.  Finally, we modified the buddy allocator to serialize
    concurrent calls to it using a lock.

<p><b>This completes the lab.</b> Commit your changes and type make
handin in the lab directory to hand in your lab.

<h2>Optional challenge</h2>

<p>Dynamically allocate other data structures in xv6 that are
  statically allocated.  Some require significant amount of changes
  (e.g., dynamically allocating proc structures), but others are
  simple.
