<h1>Lab: locks</h1>

<p>In this lab you'll gain experience in re-designing code to increase
parallelism. A common symptom of poor parallelism on multi-core
machines is high lock contention. Improving parallelism often involves
changing both data structures and locking strategies in order to
reduce contention. You'll do this for the xv6 memory allocator and
block cache.

<p>Before writing code, you should make sure you have read "Chapter 4:
  Locking" from the <a href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev0.pdf">xv6
  book</a> and studied the corresponding code.

  
<pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout lock</kbd>
</pre>

  
<h2>Memory allocator</h2>

<p>The program user/kalloctest stresses xv6's memory allocator: three
  processes grow and shrink their address spaces, resulting in many
  calls to <tt>kalloc</tt> and <tt>kfree</tt>.
  <tt>kalloc</tt> and <tt>kfree</tt>
  obtain <tt>kmem.lock</tt>.  kalloctest prints the number of
  test-and-sets that did not succeed in acquiring 
  the <tt>kmem</tt> lock (and some other locks),
  which is a rough measure of contention:

<pre>
$ <kbd>kalloctest</kbd>
start test0
test0 results:
=== lock kmem/bcache stats
lock: kmem: #test-and-set 161724 #acquire() 433008
lock: bcache: #test-and-set 0 #acquire() 812
=== top 5 contended locks:
lock: kmem: #test-and-set 161724 #acquire() 433008
lock: proc: #test-and-set 290 #acquire() 961
lock: proc: #test-and-set 240 #acquire() 962
lock: proc: #test-and-set 72 #acquire() 907
lock: proc: #test-and-set 68 #acquire() 907
test0 FAIL
start test1
total allocated number of pages: 200000 (out of 32768)
test1 OK
</pre>

<p>
<tt>acquire</tt> maintains, for each lock, the count of
calls to <tt>acquire</tt> for that lock, and the
count of test-and-sets that didn't manage to acquire the lock.
  kalloctest calls
  a system call that causes the kernel to print those counts for the
  kmem and bcache locks (which are the focus of this lab) and for
  the 5 most contended locks.  If there is lock contention the
  number of test-and-sets will be high because it takes many loop
  iterations before acquire obtains the lock.  The system call returns
  the sum of the #test-and-sets for the kmem and bcache locks.

<p>For this lab, you must use a dedicated unloaded machine with multiple
cores. If you use a machine that is doing other things, the test-and-set
counts that kalloctest prints will be nonsense. You can use a dedicated
Athena workstation, or your own laptop, but don't use a dialup machine.

<p>The root cause of lock contention in kalloctest is that <tt>kalloc()</tt> has a
  single free list, protected by a single lock.  To remove lock
  contention, you will have to redesign the memory allocator to avoid
  a single lock and list.  The basic idea is to maintain a free list
  per CPU, each list with its own lock. Allocations and frees on different
  CPUs can run in parallel, because each CPU will operate on a
  different list. The main challenge will be to deal with the case
  in which one CPU's free list is empty, but another CPU's list has free
  memory; in that case, the one CPU must "steal" part of the other
  CPU's free list.  Stealing may introduce lock contention, but that
  will hopefully be infrequent.

<div class="required">
<p>Your job is to implement per-CPU freelists and stealing when one
  CPU's list is empty.  Run kalloctest to see if your
  implementation has reduced lock contention, and to check that it can still allocate
  all of memory. Your output will look similar to that shown below, although
  the specific numbers will differ. Make sure usertests still passes.

<p>
Please give all of your locks <tt>initlock</tt> names that start with "kmem".
  
<p>Some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>You can use the constant <tt>NCPU</tt> from kernel/param.h
    <li>Let <tt>freerange</tt> give all free memory to the CPU
      running <tt>freerange</tt>.
    <li>The function <tt>cpuid</tt> returns the current core number, but 
    it's only safe to call it and use its result when
    interrupts are turned off. You should use
    <tt>push_off()</tt> and <tt>pop_off()</tt> to turn
    interrupts off and on.
  </ul>

<h2>Buffer cache</h2>

<p>If multiple processes use the file system intensively, they
  will likely contend for <tt>bcache.lock</tt>, which protects the disk block
  cache in kernel/bio.c.
  <tt>bcachetest</tt> creates
  several processes that repeatedly read different files
  in order to generate contention on <tt>bcache.lock</tt>;
  its output looks like this (before you complete this lab):

<pre>
$ <kbd>bcachetest</kbd>
start test0
test0 results:
=== lock kmem/bcache stats
lock: kmem: #test-and-set 0 #acquire() 33026
lock: kmem: #test-and-set 0 #acquire() 50
lock: kmem: #test-and-set 0 #acquire() 73
lock: bcache: #test-and-set 186438 #acquire() 65650
=== top 5 contended locks:
lock: bcache: #test-and-set 186438 #acquire() 65650
lock: proc: #test-and-set 52912 #acquire() 66921
lock: proc: #test-and-set 14693 #acquire() 66568
lock: proc: #test-and-set 13379 #acquire() 66568
lock: proc: #test-and-set 12117 #acquire() 66568
test0: FAIL
start test1
test1 OK
</pre>
You will likely see different output, but
the number of test-and-sets for the <tt>bcache</tt> lock will be high.
If you look at the code in <tt>kernel/bio.c</tt>, you'll see that
<tt>bcache.lock</tt> protects the list of cached block buffers,
the reference count (<tt>b->refcnt</tt>) in each block buffer, and the identities of
the cached blocks (<tt>b->dev</tt> and <tt>b->blockno</tt>).

<p>

<div class="required">
  <p>Modify the block cache so that the number of test-and-sets
    for all locks in the bcache is close to zero when running <tt>bcachetest</tt>.
    Ideally the sum of test-and-sets of all locks involved in the block
    cache should be zero, but it's OK if the sum is less than 500.
    Modify <tt>bget</tt>
    and <tt>brelse</tt> so that concurrent lookups and releases for
    different blocks that are in the bcache are unlikely to conflict
    on locks (e.g., don't all have to wait for
  <tt>bcache.lock</tt>).
You must maintain the invariant that at
  most one copy of a block is cached.  When you are done, your
  output should be similar to that shown below (though not identical).
  Make sure usertests still passes.

<p>
Please give all of your locks  names that start with "bcache".
That is, you should call
<tt>initlock</tt>
for each of your locks,
and pass a name that starts with "bcache".

<p>
  Reducing contention in the block cache is more
  tricky than for kalloc, because bcache buffers are truly
  shared among processes (and thus CPUs).
  For kalloc, one could eliminate most contention by
  giving each CPU its own
  allocator; that won't work for the block cache.
We suggest you look up block numbers in the cache with a hash table
that has a lock per hash bucket.

<p>
There are some circumstances in which it's OK if your solution
has lock conflicts:
<ul>
<li>When two processes concurrently use the same block number.
<tt>bcachetest</tt> <tt>test0</tt> doesn't ever do this.
<li>When two processes concurrently miss in the cache, and
need to find an unused block to replace.
<tt>bcachetest</tt> <tt>test0</tt> doesn't ever do this.
<li>When two processes concurrently use blocks that conflict
in whatever scheme you use to partition the blocks and
locks; for example, if two processes use blocks whose block
numbers hash to the same slot in a hash table.
<tt>bcachetest</tt> <tt>test0</tt> might do this, depending on your
design, but you should try to adjust your scheme's
details to avoid conflicts (e.g., change the size of
your hash table).
</ul>

<p>
<tt>bcachetest</tt>'s <tt>test1</tt> uses more distinct blocks than there are buffers,
  and exercises lots of file system code paths.

<p>Here are some hints:
  <ul>
    <li>Read the description of the block cache in the xv6 book (Section 7.2).

    <li>It is OK to use a fixed number of buckets and not resize the
    hash table dynamically. Use a prime number of
    buckets (e.g., 13) to reduce the likelihood of hashing conflicts.

    <li>Searching in the hash table for a buffer and allocating an
      entry for that buffer when the buffer is not found must be
      atomic.

    <li>Remove the list of all buffers (<tt>bcache.head</tt> etc.)
    and instead time-stamp buffers using the
    time of their last use (i.e., using <tt>ticks</tt> in kernel/trap.c).
    With this change <tt>brelse</tt> doesn't need to acquire the bcache
    lock, and <tt>bget</tt> can select the least-recently used block
    based on the time-stamps.

    <li>It is OK to serialize eviction in <tt>bget</tt> (i.e., the
    part of <tt>bget</tt> that selects a buffer to re-use when
    a lookup misses in the cache).

    <li>Your solution might need to hold two locks in some cases; for
    example, during eviction you may need to hold the bcache lock and
    a lock per bucket.  Make sure you avoid deadlock.

    <li>When replacing a block, you might move a <tt>struct buf</tt> from one
    bucket to another bucket, because the new block hashes to a
    different bucket.  You might have a
    tricky case: the new block might hash to the same bucket as the
    old block.  Make sure you avoid deadlock in that case.
          
  </ul>

<p>Optional:
  <ul>
  <li>make lookup lock-free. Hint: use gcc's <tt>__sync_*</tt>
    functions. How do you convince yourself that your implementation is correct?
  </ul>
