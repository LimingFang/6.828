<h1>Lab: networking</h1>

<p>In this lab you will write a device driver for a network interface card (NIC)
and add support for UDP network sockets to xv6.

<p>Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the <tt>net</tt> branch:

<pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout net</kbd>
</pre>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Before writing code, you may find it helpful to review "Chapter 4: Traps and
device drivers", "Section 7.13: File descriptor layer" from the <a
href="../xv6/book-riscv-rev0.pdf">xv6 book</a>, and
  <a href="../lec/l-networking.pdf">the lecture notes on networking</a>.

<p>We will be using a virtual network device called the E1000 to handle network
communication. To xv6 (and the driver you write), the E1000 looks like a real
piece of hardware connected to a real Ethernet local area network (LAN). But in
reality, the E1000 your driver will talk to is an emulation provided by qemu,
connected to a LAN that is also emulated by qemu. On this LAN, xv6 (the "guest")
has an IP address of 10.0.2.15. The only other (emulated) computer on the LAN
has IP address 10.0.2.2. qemu arranges that when xv6 uses the E1000 to send a
packet to 10.0.2.2, it's really delivered to the appropriate application on the
(real) computer on which you're running qemu (the "host").

<p> We will be using QEMU's user mode network stack since it requires no
administrative privileges to run. QEMU's documentation has more about user-net
<a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/download/qemu-doc.html#Using-the-user-mode-network-stack">here</a>.
We've updated the Makefile to enable QEMU's user-mode network stack and the
virtual E1000 network card.

<p> We also configured QEMU's network stack to record all incoming and outgoing
packets to <tt>packets.pcap</tt> in your lab directory. It may be helpful to review
these recordings to confirm that xv6 is sending and receiving the packets you
expect. To get a hex/ASCII dump of captured packets use <tt>tcpdump</tt> like
this:

<pre>
<kbd>tcpdump -XXnr packets.pcap</kbd>
</pre>

<p> Finally, we have provided you with all the code you will need to handle
parsing and crafting packet headers for ethernet, IP, UDP, and ARP. Make sure
to review this code in <tt>kernel/net.c</tt> and <tt>kernel/net.h</tt>. A
simple abstraction, called an <tt>mbuf</tt>, is provided to store and manage
packet payloads. It will be used throughout this lab assignment. 

<h2>Part 1: Network device driver</h2>

<p>In this part of the assignment, you will complete the implementation of the
E1000 networking driver. So far, code has been provided to discover and
initialize the device, and to handle interrupts, but not to send and receive
packets.

<p>Browse Intel's <a
href="../readings/hardware/8254x_GBe_SDM.pdf">Software Developer's Manual</a>
for the E1000.  This manual covers several closely related Ethernet controllers.
QEMU emulates the 82540EM. You should skim over chapter 2 now to get a feel for
the device.  To write your driver, you'll need to be familiar with chapters 3
and 14, as well as 4.1 (though not 4.1's subsections).  You'll also need to use
chapter 13 as reference.  The other chapters mostly cover components of the
E1000 that your driver won't have to interact with.  Don't worry about the
details right now; just get a feel for how the document is structured so you can
find things later. Keep in mind that the E1000 has many advanced features, but
you can ignore most of these. Only a small set of basic features is needed to
complete the lab assignment.

<h3>Your Job</h3>

<p>Your job is to implement support for sending and receiving packets. You'll
need to fill in the missing section in <tt>e1000_recv()</tt> and
<tt>e1000_transmit()</tt>, both in <tt>kernel/e1000.c</tt>.

<p>Both sending and receiving packets is managed by a queue of descriptors that
is shared between xv6 and the E1000 in memory. These queues provide
pointers to memory locations for the E1000 to DMA (i.e. transfer) packet
data.  They are implemented as circular arrays, meaning that when the card or
the driver reach the end of the array, it wraps back around to the beginning. A
common abbreviation is to refer to the receive data structures as RX and the
transmit data structures as TX.

<p>The E1000 generates an interrupt whenever new packets are received. Your
receive code must scan the RX queue to handle each packet that has arrived and
deliver its mbuf to the protocol layer by calling <tt>net_rx()</tt>. <tt>struct
rx_desc</tt> describes the descriptor format. You will then need to allocate a
new mbuf and program it into the descriptor so that the E1000 knows where to
place the next payload when it eventually reaches the same location in the array
at a later time.

<p>Packet sends are requested by the protocol layer when it calls
<tt>e1000_transmit()</tt>. Your transmit code must enqueue the mbuf into the TX
queue. This includes extracting the payload's location in memory and its length,
and encoding this information into a descriptor in the TX queue. <tt>struct
tx_desc</tt> describes the descriptor format. You will need to ensure that mbufs
are eventually freed, but only after the transmission has finished (the NIC can
encode a notification bit in the descriptor to indicate this).

<p>In addition to reading and writing to the circular arrays of descriptors,
you'll need to interact with the E1000 through memory mapped I/O to detect when
new descriptors are available on the receive path and to inform the E1000 that
new descriptors have been provided on the transmit path. A pointer to the
device's I/O is stored in <tt>regs</tt>, and it can be accessed as an array of
control registers.  You'll need to use indices <tt>E1000_RDT</tt> and
<tt>E1000_TDT</tt> in particular.

<h3>Hints</h3>

<p> Make sure to consider locking. In general, whenever memory is shared, a
lock is needed to synchronize access.

<p> Here are some hints for sending:

<ul>

<li> For transmitting, first get the current ring position, using
<tt>E1000_TDT</tt>.

<li> Then check if the the ring is overflowing. If <tt>E1000_TXD_STAT_DD</tt> is
not set in the current descriptor, a previous transmission is still in flight,
so return an error.

<li> Otherwise, use <tt>mbuffree()</tt> to free the last mbuf that was
transmitted with the current descriptor (if there was one).

<li> Then fill in the descriptor, providing the new mbuf's head pointer and
length. Set the necessary cmd flags (read the E1000 manual) and stash away a
pointer to the new mbuf for later freeing.

<li> Finally, update the ring position by adding one to <tt>E1000_TDT</tt>
  modulo <tt>TX_RING_SIZE</tt>.

<li> If transmit added the mbuf successfully to the ring, return 0
  (otherwise the caller will free the mbuf). On failure (e.g., there
  is no descriptor available to transmit the mbuf), return -1 (so that
  the caller knows to free the mbuf).
  
</ul>

<p> Here are some hints for receiving:

<ul>
    
<li> First get the next ring position, using <tt>E1000_RDT</tt>
plus one modulo <tt>RX_RING_SIZE</tt>.

<li> Then check if a new packet is available by checking for the
<tt>E1000_RXD_STAT_DD</tt> bit in the <tt>status</tt> portion of the descriptor.
If not, stop.

<li> Otherwise, update the mbuf's length to the length reported in the
  descriptor (e.g., use <tt>mbufput()</tt>).  Deliver the mbuf to the
  protocol layer using <tt>net_rx()</tt>.  (<tt>e1000_init()</tt>
  allocates an mbuf for each slot in the receive ring initially.)
 
<li> Then allocate a new mbuf (because <tt>net_rx()</tt> maybe hanging
  on to the mbuf passed to it) and program its head pointer into the
descriptor.  Clear the descriptor's status bits to zero.

<li> Finally, update the <tt>E1000_RDT</tt> register to the next position by
writing to it.

</ul>

<p> Finally, here are some hints for testing when you're done implementing the
missing sections of the E1000 driver. We have provided a tool that can be run by
typing <tt>make ping</tt> in a terminal. Be careful to run it on the same
machine that is running an instance your xv6 kernel in QEMU. The ping tool will
send one UDP packet to your network stack each second. Add a printf to your
<tt>e1000_recv()</tt> function to verify that you're receiving each UDP ping
packet. In particular, check that you can receive more than 16 packets (the size
of the descriptor ring). If you run into issues, it may be helpful to inspect
<tt>packets.pcap</tt> to see how it compares to the printouts generated by your
driver.

<h2>Part 2: Network sockets</h2>

<p> Now that you have finished the E1000 driver, you will need to support
userspace applications. To help with this, a test user program called
<tt>nettests</tt> has been provided, but you will need to implement support for
network sockets first so that it can interact with xv6.

<p> Network sockets are a standard abstraction for OS networking that bear
similarity to files. Sockets are accessed through ordinary file descriptors
(just like files, pipes, and devices). Reading from a socket file descriptor
receives a packet while writing to it sends a packet. If no packets are
currently available to be received, the reader must block and wait for the next
packet to arrive (i.e. allow rescheduling to another process). In this lab, you
will be implementing a stripped down version of sockets that supports the UDP
network protocol.

<p> Each network socket only receives packets for a particular combination of
local and remote IP addresses and port numbers, and xv6 is required to support
multiple sockets. A socket can be created and bound to the requested addresses
and ports via the <tt>connect</tt> system call, which returns a file descriptor.
The implementation of this system
  call is in <tt>kernel/sysfile.c</tt>. The code for <tt>sockalloc()</tt>
  and related functions is in <tt>kernel/sysnet.c</tt>.

<p> Take note of the provided data structures; one <tt>struct sock</tt> object
is created for each socket. <tt>sockets</tt> is a singly linked list of all
active sockets. It is useful for finding which socket to deliver newly received
packets to. In addition, each socket object maintains a queue of mbufs waiting
to be received. Received packets will stay in these queues until the
<tt>read()</tt> system call dequeues them.

<h3>Your job</h3>

<p> Your job is to implement the missing functionality necessary to support
network sockets.  This includes adding and integrating functions to support
reading, writing, and closing sockets. It also includes completing the
implementation of <tt>sockrecvudp()</tt>, which is called each time a new UDP
packet is received. To achieve this, fill in the missing sections in
<tt>kernel/sysnet.c</tt> and modify <tt>kernel/file.c</tt> to call your socket
methods.

<h3>Hints</h3>

<p> Here are some hints:

<ul>

<li> Carefully read <tt>kernel/pipe.c</tt>. It provides an example of
implementing one type of file. Sockets are another type of file, and they will
require the same file methods.

<li> Define your socket methods for read, write, and close in
<tt>kernel/defs.h</tt>.  Integrate each of these methods into the appropriate
call sites in <tt>kernel/file.c</tt> by checking whether the socket type is
<tt>FD_SOCK</tt>.

<li> For the read method, check if <tt>rxq</tt> is empty
using <tt>mbufq_empty()</tt>, and if it is, use
<tt>sleep()</tt> to wait until an mbuf is enqueued. (Don't forget to
wrap the <tt>sleep()</tt> call into a while
loop as other usages of <tt>sleep()</tt> do). Using <tt>mbufq_pophead</tt>, pop the mbuf from <tt>rxq</tt>
and use <tt>copyout()</tt> to move its payload into user memory. Free
the mbuf using <tt>mbuffree()</tt> to finish.
 
<li> For the write method, allocate a new mbuf, taking care to leave enough
headroom for the UDP, IP, and Ethernet headers. Use <tt>mbufput()</tt> and
<tt>copyin()</tt> to transfer the payload from user memory into the mbuf.
Finally, use <tt>net_tx_udp()</tt> to send the mbuf.

<li> For the close method, remove the socket from the <tt>sockets</tt> list.
Then, free the socket object. Be careful to free any mbufs that have not been
read first, before freeing the <tt>struct sock</tt>.

<li> For <tt>sockrecvudp()</tt>, identify which socket (if any) can handle
the mbuf and deliver it to the appropriate <tt>rxq</tt>. Use <tt>wakeup()</tt>
to wake any waiting reader.

<li> Don't forget to consider locking throughout!

</ul>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<p> When you are finished, run the test program. If everything is correct, you
will get the following output:

<pre>
(on the host in one terminal)
$ <kbd>make server</kbd>
python2 server.py 26099
listening on localhost port 26099
<kbd>(then on xv6 in another terminal on the same machine run
  nettests; see below)</kbd>
hello world!
...


$ <kbd>nettests</kbd>
testing one ping: OK
testing single-process pings: OK
testing multi-process pings: OK
testing DNS
DNS arecord for pdos.csail.mit.edu. is [ITS_IP_ADDRESS]
DNS OK
all tests passed.
$
</pre>

<p> If you encounter any issues, try inspecting <tt>packets.pcap</tt> to see
if your E1000 driver is working properly. Adding printfs to
<tt>e1000_transmit()</tt> and <tt>e1000_recv()</tt> may also help in debugging.

<h2>Optional Challenges:</h2>

<ul>
<li> In this lab, the networking stack uses interrupts to handle ingress packet
processing, but not egress packet processing. A more sophisticated strategy
would be to queue egress packets in software and only provide a limited number
to the NIC at any one time. You can then rely on TX interrupts to refill the
transmit queue. Using this technique, it becomes possible to prioritize
different types of egress traffic.
<li> The provided networking code only partially supports ARP. Implement a full
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826">ARP cache</a> and wire it in to
<tt>net_tx_eth()</tt>.
<li> The E1000 supports multiple RX and TX queues. Configure the E1000 to
provide a queue pair for each core and modify your networking stack to support
multiple queues. Doing so has the potential to increase the throughput that
your networking stack can support as well as reduce lock contention.
<li> A singly-linked list is an inefficient way to find PCBs. Try using a hash
table and RCU instead to increase performance.
<li> <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792">ICMP</a> can provide
notifications of failed networking flows. Detect these notifications and
propogate them as errors through the socket system call interface.
<li> The E1000 supports several stateless hardware offloads, including checksum
calculation, RSC, and GRO. Use one or more of these offloads to increase the
throughput of your networking stack.
<li> The networking stack in this lab is susceptible to receive livelock. Using
the material in lecture and the reading assignment, devise and implement a
solution to fix it.
</ul>

not, please let the course staff know!
